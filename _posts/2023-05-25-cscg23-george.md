This year i participated in the [CSCG][CSCG] and managed to qualify for the finals again. All participants were required to submit three writeups to be eligible for the final round. Although i usually dislike OSINT challenges in CTF, i somewhat enjoyed this one.

# Solution
In the picture we find the following QR code

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/images/cscg23-george/qr.png"  width="150" height="150"></p>

which contains the url [https://t.me/george_contact_bot](https://t.me/george_contact_bot) . Conveniently, the bots legal message references the [source code](https://github.com/georgewoods17778/Telegram-Contact-Bot). More interestingly, George also has a second repository which is a fork of a simple contact form in php. Within the repository we find the following commit:

I expect that most people solved the challenge up to this point. Admittedly, the next part is easy to miss. Now there are a few places we could look for further information. Maybe the initial picture has stuff hidden inside ~~(CSCG would never feature steganography)~~, or there is something up with the telegram bot. Whenever you stumble across a Git repository, you want to search for stuff people accidentally committed. In a real world scenario we would care about tokens, hardcoded passwords, and so on. But there are only two harmless commits in George-Contact-Form repository, right? Going through the [event list of Georg](https://api.github.com/users/georgewoods17778/events), we discover this [branchless commit](https://api.github.com/repos/georgewoods17778/George-Contact-Form/commits/74e02d56239bee19da119f4a353bfef734645a18), which reveals his mail address: `george.woods17778@gmail.com`.

From here we use [GHunt](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt), an OSINT tool for investigating Google accounts. We find George's [map profile page](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686015845164860810/reviews). He uploaded a nice picture that contains the flag.

# Lessons learned
There is no vulnerability at point here, but we can still take something away. First of all, be careful what you put in your Github repository and make sure to delete it correctly if need to. Secondly, be aware that much of what you do in the Internet is visible for everybody. Maybe you want to use GHunt on your personal mail address, you will likely be surprised by the results.
